## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript, Socket.IO Client, lucide-react icons
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Socket.IO, Kysely, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or compatible SQL DB)
- **Other**: html5-qrcode (QR scanner), Zod (validation), Context API

## Architecture

### Client (Frontend)

- **React + Vite**: SPA with functional components and hooks
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication for tasks and group events
- **Custom Hooks**: For todos, groups, authentication, and socket events
- **UI/UX**: Responsive design, overlays, sheets, sidebar, and lucide-react icons

### Server (Backend)

- **Node.js + TypeScript**: API and Socket.IO server
- **Socket.IO**: Handles real-time events (task CRUD, room join/leave, user presence)
- **Kysely + Drizzle ORM**: Database abstraction and migrations
- **Authentication**: Token-based, user sessions tracked via localStorage

## User Flow

1. **Register/Login:**

   - User registers or logs in via the client UI
   - Credentials are sent to the backend REST API; a token/userId is stored in localStorage

2. **Authentication:**

   - On app load, the client checks localStorage for authentication and identifies the user to the backend via Socket.IO

3. **Group/Room Management:**

   - User can create a new group/room or join an existing one (via room ID or QR code)
   - Joining triggers both an API call (for membership) and a Socket.IO event (for real-time presence)

4. **Task Management:**

   - User creates, updates, or deletes tasks in dashboard or group context
   - Task actions emit Socket.IO events; backend updates DB and broadcasts changes to relevant users/rooms

5. **Real-Time Collaboration:**

   - All group members see updates instantly; dashboard tasks are private to the user

6. **Logout:**
   - User logs out, clearing localStorage and disconnecting the socket
